# Overview

As a software engineer, it is my goal to continually develop new skills and increase proficiency in various aspects of this profression. This project aims to provide an opportunity to delve deeper into the programming language of C++ and to practice my skills in those fundamentals. This software is a console based to-do list manager that is written in C++. It allows users to be able to add, remove, view, save, and load their tasks and it leverages core C++ conjcepts like variables, functions, classes, and STL data structures. My purpose for developing this softaware was to get my foot in the door with the C++ language and to gain an understanding of the basics for this language.
